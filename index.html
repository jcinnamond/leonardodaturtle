                Hello! Meet <em>Leonardo da Turtle</em>, the world's greatest
                digital artist. They might look like a badly drawn semicircle
                because I don't have the time or talent required to draw a
                turtle, but that's what all the digital artists are wearing
                these days.
            </p>

            <p>
                Help Leonardo create their next great masterpiece by giving them
                instructions. You can tell them to move
                <code>forward</code> a specified number of pixels. You can tell them to turn <code>left</code> or
                <code>right</code> by a specified number of degrees. For example, to draw the letter "L" you can say
            </p>

            <pre>
forward 200
left 180
forward 200
left 90
forward 100</pre>

            <p>(You can give instructions one by one or put them all on one line. Leonardo isn't fussy.)</p>
